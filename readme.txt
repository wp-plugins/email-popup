We’re confident that you’ll love Email Popup by Optin Cat. 
 
All the same, we can’t make a pact with you and sign our names in blood that you’ll love our popups plugin no matter what.

More importantly, though, we won’t make any pacts like that because we recognize that people may have different experiences with our popups plugin. If yours is one of the few that does differ, we’ll stand by your side providing whatever support you need.  
 
= -- Question #4 on Email Popup by Optin Cat =

We recognize that site load time is important to you for both conversion rates and SEO rankings. Knowing that, Email Popup by Optin Cat has been carefully built with performance in mind.

= -- Question #5 on Email Popup by Optin Cat =
 
“Do the Popups in Email Popup by Optin Cat work on mobile?”
 
It depends. If you limit yourself to just the free version of Email Popup by Optin Cat, then you won’t be able to display a popup on mobile devices. Showing a popup on mobile is one of our premium features. 
 
Can we make a suggestion here? 
 
It’s your call, of course, but we highly recommend having a popup that works on mobile devices. In fact, we’d even go so far as to say that showing your popup on mobile is a must. 
 
Why? Well, look at the trends. It’s no secret that web users are migrating away from desktop computers and onto their mobile phones. When we last checked, it was estimated that approximately 60% of web users were on their phones. That percentage is only going to increase too, as respected sources like Nielsen predict mobile web traffic eventually overtaking that of desktop. 
 
So how does this all affect you and your little popup? Simple. Your popup needs to work on mobile devices. It needs to popup at the right time, for example, when a potential customer casually reads your blog on their iPhone at Starbucks. Imagine if your popup can’t interact with this kind of prospect - someone who is relaxed, awake from the caffeine, and ready to take action. Talk about a missed opportunity. Your popup definitely needs to be there for them.
 
At least if you’re serious about your business. 
 
Not to preach, but this is really the reason why we made popup visibility on mobile as a premium feature. Anyone can download the free version of Email Popup by Optin Cat. That alone doesn’t indicate whether a person is serious or whether they just downloaded our popup plugin because the pictures of cats seemed cool.
 
What determines seriousness is whether a person will step up and commit to the premium version of Email Popup by Optin Cat. As we’ve noted, the premium version allows your popup to work on mobile devices. The premium version of our popup plugin also has a number of other features (covered elsewhere) that make it a must for those who are truly serious.
